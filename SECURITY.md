## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Raqeeb, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it responsibly by:

- Providing a clear description of the issue
- Including steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Avoiding public disclosure until the issue is addressed

📧 **Contact:**  
Security reports should be sent privately to the project maintainers.

## 🧭 Responsible Disclosure

We ask all security researchers to follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof of concept
- Do not access data that does not belong to you
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

---

## ⚠️ Authorized Use Only

Raqeeb is designed for **authorized security testing only**.

You must:
- Own the system you are testing **or**
- Have explicit, written permission to test it

Misuse of this software against unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical.

The project maintainers are not responsible for misuse.

## 🛡️ Security Philosophy

Raqeeb follows a **safe-by-design** approach:

- Observation over exploitation
- Detection-focused scanning
- No destructive actions
- No unsafe payloads

Security is treated as a core architectural concern, not an afterthought.
